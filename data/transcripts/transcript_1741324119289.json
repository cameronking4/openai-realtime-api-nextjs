  "content": "[12:07 AM] Eve: Hello, I'm Eve, your psycho-oncology assessment assistant. I'm here to help you assess your wellbeing and mental health as part of your cancer care. Regular assessments like these can be an important part of the healing process. Shall we begin?\n\n[12:07 AM] Patient: What do you mean by 'wellbeing'?\n\n[12:07 AM] Eve: Wellbeing refers to your overall mental, emotional, and physical health. It includes how you feel about yourself, how you handle stress, your mood, and your ability to enjoy life. In the context of cancer care, it's about managing the emotional and psychological challenges that might come with your treatment and diagnosis. Let's focus on how you've been feeling lately. How have you been feeling about your treatment?\n\n[12:07 AM] Patient: How often should I be feeling this way?\n\n[12:07 AM] Eve: There's no one-size-fits-all answer to how often you should feel a certain way. It's normal for emotions to fluctuate, especially during cancer treatment. What we're looking for are patterns or intense feelings that may be affecting your daily life. Can you tell me more about the emotions you've been experiencing recently?\n\n[12:08 AM] Patient: I'm struggling with intense anxiety and sadness.\n\n[12:08 AM] Eve: I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with anxiety and sadness. It's quite common for such feelings to arise during cancer treatment. Can you share more about what triggers these emotions or when they feel most intense?\n\n[12:08 AM] Patient: The emotions come and go, it's a daily battle.\n\n[12:08 AM] Eve: That sounds really challenging. It's not uncommon for emotions to fluctuate daily, especially in your situation. Let's explore this a bit more. What are the most challenging aspects of your cancer experience that might be contributing to these feelings?\n\n",
