  "content": "[3:38 PM] Eve: Hello, I'm Eve, your AI assistant trained in psycho-oncology. I'm here to help assess your well-being and mental health as part of your cancer care. Regular check-ins like this are really important in supporting your healing process. Shall we start by talking about how you've been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n[3:38 PM] Patient: Everything is awful, I can't take it anymore.\n\n[3:38 PM] Eve: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of distress. Can you share more about what's been most challenging for you recently? Your feelings are important, and I'm here to listen.\n\n[3:38 PM] Patient: Could you clarify what you mean by 'most challenging'?\n\n[3:38 PM] Eve: Of course. By 'most challenging,' I mean the aspects of your cancer experience or treatment that have been causing you the most difficulty or emotional pain. This could include physical symptoms, side effects, worries about the future, or how the illness has impacted your daily life or relationships. What's been weighing on you the most?\n\n",
