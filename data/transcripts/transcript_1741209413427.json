  "content": "[4:06 PM] Eve: Hello, and welcome! I'm Eve, your AI assistant. I'm here to support you by conducting a psycho-oncology assessment, which helps us understand your wellbeing and mental health as you go through your cancer journey. Regular assessments like these are important for your healing process. Shall we get started?\n\n[4:06 PM] Patient: Can you explain more?\n\n[4:06 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[4:06 PM] Eve: Certainly! A psycho-oncology assessment focuses on understanding how you're coping emotionally and mentally with your cancer diagnosis and treatment. We'll talk about how you're feeling, any challenges you're facing, and the support you have. The goal is to identify areas where we can offer help or resources to improve your overall wellbeing. It's a safe space to share your thoughts and emotions, and I'm here to listen and support you. Let's begin by talking about how you've been feeling about your treatment lately. How has it been for you?\n\n[4:06 PM] Patient: No\n\n[4:06 PM] Eve: That's perfectly okay. It's not always easy to put feelings into words. Let's try a different approach. Can you tell me about a recent day or moment that stood out to you, whether it was challenging or positive? This might help us understand how you're feeling.\n\n",
