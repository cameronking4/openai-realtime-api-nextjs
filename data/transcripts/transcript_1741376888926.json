  "content": "[2:45 PM] Eve: Hello, I'm Eve, your AI assistant for psycho-oncology assessments. It's great to meet you. Regular wellbeing assessments are important in the healing process, and I'm here to support you with that today. Shall we begin?\n\n[2:46 PM] Patient: Yes, let's get started!\n\n[2:46 PM] Eve: Excellent. To start, I'd like to know how you've been feeling about your treatment lately. Can you share your thoughts with me?\n\n[2:46 PM] Patient: And what now?\n\n[2:46 PM] Eve: You can share any feelings or concerns you have about your treatment. How have you been feeling about it lately?\n\n[2:46 PM] Patient: Absolutely exhausted, can't take it anymore.\n\n[2:46 PM] Eve: I hear you, and I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so exhausted. It's completely understandable given what you're going through. Could you tell me a bit more about what aspects are most tiring or challenging for you?\n\n[2:46 PM] Patient: What do you mean by 'challenging' aspects?\n\n[2:46 PM] Eve: By 'challenging' aspects, I mean anything specific about your treatment or daily life that's been particularly difficult for you to handle. This could be physical symptoms, emotional struggles, or even practical issues. What stands out as most demanding for you?\n\n[2:46 PM] Patient: I'm barely hanging on...\n\n[2:47 PM] Eve: I'm here to support you. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's a heavy burden to carry. Could you share more about what's making it hard to hang on? Your feelings, physical symptoms, or anything else that comes to mind.\n\n[2:47 PM] Patient: My anxiety\n\n[2:47 PM] Eve: Thank you for sharing that. Anxiety can be very tough to manage. How has your anxiety been affecting you lately, especially in relation to your treatment or daily life?\n\n[2:47 PM] Patient: can we start over?\n\n[2:47 PM] Eve: Of course, we can start over. Let's take a fresh approach. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n",
