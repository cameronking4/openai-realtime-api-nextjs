I'm here to support you with a psycho-oncology assessment, which is an important part of your healing process. We'll talk about your wellbeing and mental health, focusing on how you've been feeling and coping. Let's begin. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n[4:41 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[4:41 PM] Eve: Of course, I understand it can be a bit unclear. This assessment is designed to check in on your mental and emotional wellbeing as you go through your cancer treatment. We'll discuss things like your feelings about the treatment, your mood, any challenges you're facing, and how confident you feel in managing your symptoms. Also, we'll talk about the support you have. It helps us understand your needs better and provide the right support. How does that sound?\n\n",
