It's important to regularly check in on how you're feeling, both mentally and emotionally, during your treatment. Shall we begin?\n\n[7:21 PM] Patient: I don't know if I can do this.\n\n[7:21 PM] Eve: It's completely normal to feel unsure or overwhelmed. Let's take it one step at a time, and remember, this is a space for you to share and reflect on your feelings. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n",
