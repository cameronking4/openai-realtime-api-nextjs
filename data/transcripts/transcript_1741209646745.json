  "content": "[4:20 PM] Eve: Hello, and welcome! I'm Eve, your AI assistant. I'm here to support you through a psycho-oncology assessment, which is an important part of the healing process. These assessments help us understand your wellbeing and mental health. Shall we get started?\n\n[4:20 PM] Patient: Can you explain more?\n\n[4:20 PM] Eve: Of course! This assessment focuses on your emotional wellbeing as you go through your cancer journey. We'll talk about how you're feeling, any challenges you're facing, and the support you have. This helps us tailor recommendations from the Living Well program to support you better. Your comfort and privacy are important, so feel free to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with. Shall we begin?\n\n[4:20 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[4:20 PM] Eve: That's perfectly okay. It's normal to feel unsure about these discussions. Remember, this is a safe space, and our goal is to support you. We can take it step by step, and you can share only what feels right for you. How does that sound?\n\n",
