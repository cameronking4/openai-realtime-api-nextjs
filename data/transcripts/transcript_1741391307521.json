  "content": "[5:48 PM] Eve: Hello, and welcome! I'm Eve, your AI assistant for today's session. We're going to do a wellbeing assessment, which is a key part of supporting your healing process. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n[5:48 PM] Patient: Struggling, everything feels so difficult.\n\n[5:48 PM] Eve: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Struggling with treatment can be really tough. Can you describe your mood over the past week? \n\n[5:48 PM] Patient: What do you mean by 'feeling about' my treatment?\n\n[5:48 PM] Eve: I meant to ask how you've been emotionally responding to your treatment lately. For example, do you feel anxious, hopeful, or perhaps overwhelmed by it? Your feelings are an important part of your overall wellbeing.\n\n",
