Regular check-ins like this are important for your healing process. Let's get started, shall we? How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n[3:46 PM] Patient: Absolutely exhausted, not sure I can continue.\n\n[3:46 PM] Eve: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling so exhausted. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's been the most challenging aspect for you recently?\n\n",
