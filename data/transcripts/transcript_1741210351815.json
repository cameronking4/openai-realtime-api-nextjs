I'm here to conduct a psycho-oncology assessment, focusing on your mental and emotional well-being as you navigate through your cancer experience. We'll talk about how you're feeling, coping, and the support you have. This assessment helps tailor support to your needs, promoting a holistic healing process. Shall we begin?\n\n[4:32 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[4:32 PM] Eve: That's perfectly okay. Let's take it step by step. I'm here to support you and understand your feelings and concerns. How about we start with a simple question: How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n[4:32 PM] Patient: Yes\n\n[4:32 PM] Eve: Great. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately? Are there any specific emotions or thoughts you've been experiencing?\n\n",
