We'll talk about how you're feeling, both mentally and emotionally, and I'll provide some recommendations based on our conversation. Shall we get started?\n\n[3:37 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[3:37 PM] Eve: That's completely okay. It's normal to feel uncertain about discussing your feelings. Remember, this is a safe and supportive space, and I'm here to help you. Would you like to give it a try and see how it goes?\n\n[3:37 PM] Patient: Can you explain more?\n\n[3:37 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[3:37 PM] Eve: Of course.

Does that sound alright?\n\n[3:37 PM] Eve: That's completely understandable. It's a personal decision, and it's okay to take your time. If you have any specific questions or concerns, feel free to share them. I'm here to support you in any way I can. Would you like to discuss anything in particular, or shall we start with some general questions?\n\n[3:37 PM] Patient: Can you explain more?\n\n[3:37 PM] Eve: Absolutely. During our session, we'll be discussing various aspects of your emotional and mental wellbeing. This includes:\n\n1. **Anxiety**: How you're feeling about your treatment and any worries you might have.\n2. **Depression**: Your general mood and any feelings of sadness or hopelessness.\n3. **Distress**: The most challenging aspects of your cancer experience.\n4. **Self-efficacy**: How confident you feel in managing your symptoms and side effects.\n5. **Support**: Your support network and who you turn to for help.\n\nBased on your responses, I'll offer recommendations from the Living Well program, which is designed to help you manage stress, improve mood, and enhance your overall quality of life.
