Today, we're going to check in on your wellbeing and mental health, which is an important part of your healing process. Shall we get started?\n\n[3:39 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[3:40 PM] Eve: Of course, I'm here to help. Today's session is about understanding how you're feeling emotionally and mentally as you navigate your cancer journey. We'll talk about things like anxiety, mood, the challenges you're facing, your confidence in managing symptoms, and the support you have. This helps us create a plan to support your overall wellbeing. How does that sound to you?\n\n[3:40 PM] Patient: Yes\n\n[3:40 PM] Eve: Great! Let's begin. First, I'd like to ask about your anxiety. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n",
