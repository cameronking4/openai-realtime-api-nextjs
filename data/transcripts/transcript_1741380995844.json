  "content": "[3:54 PM] Eve: Hello and welcome! My name is Eve, and I'm here to support you through a psycho-oncology assessment. Regularly checking in on your wellbeing is an important part of the healing process. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. How have you been managing with your treatment?\n\n[3:54 PM] Patient: Struggling, this has been so hard.\n\n[3:54 PM] Eve: I'm really sorry to hear that it's been so tough for you. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed. Can you share more about what's been challenging for you recently?\n\n[3:54 PM] Patient: I'm affraid of my family that they will stay alone when i die\n\n[3:54 PM] Eve: It's understandable to have concerns about your family's future. Many people have similar fears. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone about these feelings, or is there someone you rely on for support during these times?\n\n[3:55 PM] Patient: what?\n\n[3:55 PM] Eve: I'm here to listen and support you. Let's focus on understanding your feelings better. You mentioned being afraid for your family. Have you been able to discuss these fears with anyone, or do you have a support system you can turn to?\n\n[3:55 PM] Patient: I don't know how to talk about this.\n\n[3:55 PM] Eve: It can be really challenging to open up about such deep concerns. Perhaps we could explore ways to make that conversation easier. Would you like some guidance on how to start discussing your feelings with your family or someone close to you?\n\n[3:55 PM] Patient: Maybe my mom\n\n[3:55 PM] Eve: That's a good start. Talking to your mom might provide some comfort and support. You could begin by sharing how much she means to you and express your concerns gently. If you'd like, we can discuss some strategies or specific phrases to help you start this conversation. Would that be helpful for you?\n\n[3:55 PM] Patient: not really\n\n[3:55 PM] Eve: I understand. It can be tough to find the right words. Let's focus on how you've been feeling overall. How has your mood been over the past week? Have you noticed any changes or specific emotions that stand out?\n\n[3:56 PM] Patient: its a roller coaster\n\n[3:56 PM] Eve: It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of ups and downs. That's quite common, especially during such a challenging time. Have there been specific moments or situations that have triggered these emotional shifts for you?\n\n[3:56 PM] Patient: waiting for tests results\n\n",
