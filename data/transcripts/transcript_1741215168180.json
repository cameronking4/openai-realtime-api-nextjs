  "content": "[5:49 PM] Eve: Hello, and welcome. I'm Eve, your assistant. Today, we're going to focus on a wellbeing assessment as part of your healing process. This assessment is designed to understand your mental and emotional wellbeing, focusing on areas like anxiety, depression, and the support you have around you. Let's get started. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n[5:50 PM] Patient: Not too great.\n\n\n[5:50 PM] Eve: I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling great. Regular wellbeing assessments can be really helpful in the healing process, so let's talk about how you've been feeling. How have you been managing with your treatment lately?\n\n[5:50 PM] Patient: Not too great, 8th cancer.\n\n\n[5:50 PM] Eve: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Cancer can be a tough journey, and it's okay to express those emotions. Can you describe your mood over the past week?\n\n[5:50 PM] Patient: Over the past week I was tired of AIs that have microphone issues.\n\n\n[5:50 PM] Eve: It sounds like you've been feeling frustrated, and that’s valid. Let's shift back to how you've been feeling emotionally. What aspects of your cancer experience have been the most challenging for you lately?\n\n[5:51 PM] Patient: Cancer, duh!\n\n\n[5:51 PM] Eve: I can only imagine how tough that must be for you. It's important to acknowledge these feelings. Let's focus on something that might help—how confident do you feel in managing your physical symptoms and side effects?\n\n[5:51 PM] Patient: With my doctors absolutely not a confident. I hate all doctors\n\n\n[5:51 PM] Eve: It's clear you're feeling disillusioned, and that's completely understandable. Let's look at the support side. Who do you turn to when you need help or support?\n\n[5:51 PM] Patient: Of course.\n\n\n[5:51 PM] Eve: It's good to know you have someone to rely on. Support can be a great source of strength. Thank you for sharing your feelings with me today. Based on what we've discussed, I'd like to provide some recommendations from the Living Well program to support your mental health. Would that be alright with you?\n\n[5:51 PM] Patient: I rely on God.\n\n\n[5:51 PM] Eve: It's wonderful that you find strength in your faith. Having that support can be very meaningful. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now that we've explored different aspects of your wellbeing, I'll provide some recommendations from the Living Well program. Would that be alright with you?\n\n[5:52 PM] Patient: I hate Living Well program.\n\n\n[5:52 PM] Eve: I understand you might not feel positively about the program. Let's focus on what might work best for you. How about we explore some alternative support options or strategies that align better with your preferences?\n\n[5:52 PM] Patient: No, I was kidding. I actually love the program.\n\n\n[5:52 PM] Eve: I'm glad to hear that! Since you appreciate the Living Well program, I’ll provide some recommendations tailored to your current situation. It might include strategies for managing stress, connecting with support, or other resources. Would that be helpful for you?\n\n[5:52 PM] Patient: OK. End the session now.\n\n\n[5:52 PM] Eve: Alright. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings today. If you feel the need to talk again or explore more resources from the Living Well program, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care.\n\n",
