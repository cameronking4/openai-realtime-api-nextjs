Regular wellbeing check-ins are an important part of your healing process, and I'm here to help guide you through this. How have you been feeling about your treatment lately?\n\n[4:36 PM] Patient: Not sure\n\n[4:36 PM] Patient: No\n\n[4:36 PM] Eve: Of course. Regular wellbeing assessments help us understand how you're coping with your cancer treatment, both emotionally and mentally. We focus on areas like anxiety, depression, distress, self-efficacy, and support systems. This helps us provide recommendations to enhance your overall wellbeing. It's okay if you're not sure about your feelings; we can explore them together. Shall we start with how you've been feeling about your treatment recently?\n\n",
